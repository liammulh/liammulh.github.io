                    I (Liam Mulhall) am a software engineer based in the Bay
                    Area. I prefer to think of myself as someone who solves
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Colorado. I did the things
                    you're legally required to do as a Coloradan: hiking,
                    skiing, and owning a pair of Chaco sandals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an undergraduate at the University of Colorado, I
                    studied biology, physics, and math. I graduated with a
                    bachelor's degree in pure math with a focus on computational
                    math and a minor in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I graduated, I took a job as a software engineer at
                    Physics Education Technologies (PhET), an education
                    non-profit in Boulder, Colorado. I also worked on
                    Numberscope, an experimental web application that can be
                    used to create visualizations of integer sequences like the
                    Fibonacci sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2023, I took a job at Stanford, and because I'm a
                    masochist, I also started a master's degree in computer
                    science at Georgia Tech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of writing software, I enjoy writing prose. I'm
                    bad at it, but I don't let that stop me. I also enjoy
                    playing modern board games.
                </p>

                    It's lovingly handwritten in HTML with a few lines CSS thrown in to
                    spruce it up. It's artisanal. (How dare you accuse me of being a
                    hipster?) The images at the top and bottom of each page are the top
