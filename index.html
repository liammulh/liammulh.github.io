                    I (Liam Mulhall) am a software engineer based in the Bay
                    Area. I prefer to think of myself as someone who solves
                    problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Colorado. I did the things
                    you're legally required to do as a Coloradan: hiking,
                    skiing, and owning a pair of Chaco sandals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an undergraduate at the University of Colorado, I
                    studied biology, physics, and math. I graduated with a
                    bachelor's degree in pure math with a focus on computational
                    math and a minor in computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2023, I took a job at Stanford, and because I'm a
                    masochist, I also started a master's degree in computer
                    science at Georgia Tech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of writing software, I enjoy writing prose. I'm
                    bad at it, but I don't let that stop me. I also enjoy
                    playing modern board games.
                </p>
                <h2>About this website</h2>
                <p>
                    This '90s-chic website is lovingly handwritten in HTML with
                    a few lines CSS thrown in to spruce it up. It's artisanal.
                    (How dare you accuse me of being a hipster?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website's primary <i>raison d'Ãªtre</i> is to be a place
                    where I can write about software engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The images at the top and bottom of each page are the top
                    and bottom of an

                    computer program punch card. It's my little homage to the
                    scientists and engineers who made my profession possible.
                    If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders
                    of giants.

                    mine, receives light without darkening me.
